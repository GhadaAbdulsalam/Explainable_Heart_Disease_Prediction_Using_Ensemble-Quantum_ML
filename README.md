# Explainable Heart Disease Prediction Using Ensemble-Quantum Machine Learning Approach
an ensemble machine learning model based on quantum ‎machine learning ‎classifiers is proposed to predict the risk of heart disease. 
The proposed ‎model ‎is a bagging ensemble learning model where Quantum ‎Support Vector ‎Classifier is used as the base classifier.
Furthermore, in order to make the ‎model's outcomes more explainable, the importance of every single feature in ‎the prediction is computed and visualized using SHapley Additive exPlanations ‎‎(SHAP) framework.
In the experimental study, other stand-alone quantum ‎classifiers, namely, ‎Quantum Support Vector Classifier (QSVC‎),‎ Quantum ‎Neural Network ‎‎(QNN), and Variational ‎‎Quantum Classifier ‎(VQC)
were ‎applied and compared with classical machine learning classifiers ‎such as ‎Support Vector ‎Classifier ‎(SVC), and Artificial Neural Network ‎(ANN). ‎
